# AI-ML-Soccer-Analysis

**Project Overview:** Developed an AI-driven football analysis system utilizing YOLO (real-time object detection software), OpenCV, and Python to automate player, referee, and ball detection and tracking in football match videos.

**Key Features:**
- Object Detection and Tracking: Implemented YOLO for real-time detection and tracking of players, referees, and the ball, enhancing video analysis with precise bounding boxes.
- Custom Model Training: Utilized Roboflow's football player detection dataset for custom training, improving detection accuracy by refining class labels and excluding irrelevant objects.
- Data Handling and Preprocessing: Designed a robust pipeline for video reading, frame extraction, and output video generation using OpenCV, ensuring consistent data preparation and result reproducibility.
- Performance Optimization: Integrated object tracking algorithms to maintain detection across frames, adjusted confidence thresholds, and addressed false detections to improve model reliability.
- Output and Insights: Enabled the extraction of tactical insights and player performance metrics through advanced class detection and verification, providing valuable data for strategic analysis.
 
**Technologies/Skills:** Python, YOLO, OpenCV, Roboflow, Video Processing, Object Detection, Model Training, Data Preprocessing.
